          <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Comparing configuration files, API responses, or large JSON schemas often involves
            <strong class="text-slate-200"> sensitive production data</strong>. Online diff tools
            require you to paste your content into their servers to process it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong class="text-slate-200">SyntaxSnap</strong> calculates differences directly
            in your browser using client-side JavaScript — your data stays in your device's RAM
            and is never transmitted.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed text-sm">
            Perfect for reviewing merge conflicts, checking environment variable changes, or
